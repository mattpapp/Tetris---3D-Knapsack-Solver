# 3D Knapsack Solver

## Overview

This Java program provides a 3D knapsack solver to optimize the packing of items into a 3D container, maximizing the total value while respecting weight constraints. The project uses and requires JavaFX. The project dependencies are managed with Maven.

## Usage

To run the program, execute the `Main` class of the /src/main/java/org/tetris/threedfx folder.

```bash
java Main
```

## Graphical interface usage

In the graphical interface, you can select the piece set used by the algoritms from a drop down menu.

To start either solver algorithm, press the respective buttons. The display will update the status of the launch in the *"Output:"* field. It is possible the algorithm cannot find a solution, then it will time out after a time of 10s automatically. You can always stop the solver by pressing *"Stop solver"*.

As the solver finds solutions, the *"Output:"* field will update.
